  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
Refactoring more than just repos
  
Software Engineering is hard. For me, pursuing a CS degree at Purdue was the first time I'd ever struggled in school. I had no focus, no self control, and no idea what I wanted to do with my degree, let alone my life. It's been 6 years since I switched majors to study computer graphics instead, and while I am extremely grateful for the lessons I learned at Purdue Polytechnic, I'm not satisfied with how I left my CS career. 

This past two years, I've completed two different software engineering programs, clocking in over 9 months of training, and well over a year of dedicated effort to becoming a better software engineer. It's been a long journey, and I'll always be learning, but I'm finally building things I love, and enjoying the process. I'd love to talk about how passionate I am about programming now.

  
  <strong>How I work:</strong>
  - I bring a relaxed, can-do attitude with the drive/determination to produce my best work every time.
  - Born curious, I love discovering new ways of doing things
  - Humor is oxygen for me; I look for ways to inspire and laugh with my teammates

  <strong>My Hobbies!</strong><br/>
  Talk to me about my pour-over setup, anime, or learning Japanese!

  <strong>What am I looking for?</strong><br/>
  Looking to join a team where my coworkers are passionate, energetic, and challenge me to continue to learn. If that sounds like you, please reach out!
